I'm Kaito Tsutsui ([@ktsu2i](https://x.com/ktsu2i)), a Go-focused software engineer in Tokyo.

As the title says, I built my own blog site.

I've been writing on my company's tech blog and [Zenn](https://zenn.dev) (a dev blogging platform in Japan), but I wanted a more casual place to share my thoughts, so I decided to build one myself.

My articles were scattered across different platforms, so I brought them all together here. It's nice having everything in one place, including posts from my company's tech blog.

I also wanted to write in English for a global audience, so I added i18n support. You can switch languages with the button in the top right corner.

## Tech Stack

I usually write Go at work, but for this project I went with Astro and deployed it on Cloudflare Workers. It was surprisingly easy to set up — Astro is amazing.

It's been a while since I worked on a personal project, and it reminded me how fun it is. I signed up for the Claude Code Pro plan for personal development, so I'm looking forward to writing a lot more code. I'd love to start contributing to OSS too.

## What's Next

I'm planning to casually post things like personal write-ups, conference reports, and whatever else comes to mind. I'd be happy if you give it a read!
